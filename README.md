The biggest consern so far is the animation.

The current component contract is: every component recieves an `animationState` prop, which is an invariant of ['entering', 'entered', 'exiting', 'exited', 'unmounted']

I'll tweak this further down the line, for now if I can work out at least that, it will be good.
